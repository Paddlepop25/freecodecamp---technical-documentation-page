          Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations
          in strings. In JavaScript, regular expressions are also objects. These
          patterns are used with the exec and testmethods of RegExp, and with
          the match, matchAll, replace, search, and split methods of String.
          This chapter describes JavaScript regular expressions.

        <header>Creating a Regular Expression</header>
        <p>
          You construct a regular expression in one of two ways:
        </p>

        <p>
          Using a regular expression literal, which consists of a pattern
          enclosed between slashes, as follows:
        </p>

        <code>var re = /ab+c/; </code>

        <p>
          Regular expression literals provide compilation of the regular
          expression when the script is loaded. If the regular expression
          remains constant, using this can improve performance.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Or calling the constructor function of the RegExp object, as follows:
        </p>

        <code>var re = new RegExp('ab+c');</code>

        <p>
          Using the constructor function provides runtime compilation of the
          regular expression. Use the constructor function when you know the
          regular expression pattern will be changing, or you don't know the
          pattern and are getting it from another source, such as user input.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="writing_a_regular_expression_pattern">
        <header>Writing a Regular Expression Pattern</header>

        <p>
          A regular expression pattern is composed of simple characters, such as
          <code>/abc/</code> or a combination of simple and special characters,
          such as <code>/ab*c/</code> or <code>/Chapter (\d+)\.\d*/</code> The
          last example includes parentheses which are used as a memory device.
          The match made with this part of the pattern is remembered for later
          use, as described in Using parenthesized substring matches.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Using simple patterns</li>
          <li>Using special characters</li>
          <li>Escaping</li>
          <li>Using parentheses</li>
        </ul>

        <div id="using_simple_patterns">Using simple patterns</div>
        <p>
          Simple patterns are constructed of characters for which you want to
          find a direct match. For example, the pattern /abc/ matches character
          combinations in strings only when exactly the characters 'abc' occur
          together and in that order. Such a match would succeed in the strings
          "Hi, do you know your abc's?" and "The latest airplane designs evolved
          from slabcraft." In both cases the match is with the substring 'abc'.
          There is no match in the string 'Grab crab' because while it contains
          the substring 'ab c', it does not contain the exact substring 'abc'.
        </p>
        <br />
        <div id="using_special_characters">Using special characters</div>
        <p>
          When the search for a match requires something more than a direct
          match, such as finding one or more b's, or finding white space, you
          can include special characters in the pattern. For example, to match a
          single 'a' followed by zero or more 'b's followed by 'c', you'd use
          the pattern /ab*c/: the * after 'b' means "0 or more occurrences of
          the preceding item." In the string "cbbabbbbcdebc," the pattern
          matches the substring 'abbbbc'.
        </p>
        <br />
        <div id="escaping">Escaping</div>
        <p>
          If you need to use any of the special characters literally (actually
          searching for a '*', for instance), you must escape it by putting a
          backslash in front of it. For instance, to search for 'a' followed by
          '*' followed by 'b', you'd use /a\*b/—the backslash "escapes" the '*',
          making it literal instead of special. Similarly, if you're writing a
          regular expression literal and need to match a slash ('/'), you need
          to escape that (otherwise, it terminates the pattern).
        </p>
        <br />
        <div>Escaping - an example</div>
        <p>
          For instance,to search for the string "/example/" followed by one or
          more alphabetic characters, you'd use /\/example\/[a-z]+/i—the
          backslashes before each slash make them literal. To match a literal
          backslash, you need to escape the backslash. For instance, to match
          the string "C:\" where 'C' can be any letter, you'd use /[A-Z]:\\/—the
          first backslash escapes the one after it, so the expression searches
          for a single literal backslash.
        </p>
        <br />
        <div>Escaping - string literal</div>
        <p>
          If using the RegExp constructor with a string literal, remember that
          the backslash is an escape in string literals, so to use it in the
          regular expression, you need to escape it at the string literal level.
          /a\*b/ and new RegExp("a\\*b") create the same expression, which
          searches for 'a' followed by a literal '*' followed by 'b'. If escape
          strings are not already part of your pattern you can add them using
          String.replace:
          <code>
            function escapeRegExp(string) { return
            string.replace(/[.*+?^${}()|[\]\\]/g, '\\$&'); // $& means the whole
            matched string }</code
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          The g after the regular expression is an option or flag that performs
          a global search, looking in the whole string and returning all
          matches. It is explained in detail below in Advanced Searching With
          Flags.
        </p>
        <br />
        <div id="using_parentheses">Using Parentheses</div>
        <p>
          Parentheses around any part of the regular expression pattern causes
          that part of the matched substring to be remembered. Once remembered,
          the substring can be recalled for other use, as described in Using
          Parenthesized Substring Matches.</p>
          <br>
          <div>Parentheses - an example</div>
          <p>
          For example, the pattern /Chapter
          (\d+)\.\d*/ illustrates additional escaped and special characters and
          indicates that part of the pattern should be remembered. It matches
          precisely the characters 'Chapter ' followed by one or more numeric
          characters (\d means any numeric character and + means 1 or more
          times), followed by a decimal point (which in itself is a special
          character; preceding the decimal point with \ means the pattern must
          look for the literal character '.'), followed by any numeric character
          0 or more times (\d means numeric character, *means 0 or more times).
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          To match a substring without causing the matched part to be
          remembered, within the parentheses preface the pattern with ?:. For
          example, (?:\d+) matches one or more numeric characters but does not
          remember the matched characters.
        </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="working_with_regular_expressions">
        <header>Working with Regular Expressions</header>

        <p>
          Regular expressions are used with the RegExp methods testand exec and
          with the String methods match, replace, search, and split. These
          methods are explained in detail in the JavaScript reference.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In the following example, the script uses the exec method to find a
          match in a string.
        </p>

        <code>
          var myRe = /d(b+)d/g; var myArray = myRe.exec('cdbbdbsbz');
        </code>

        <p>
          If you do not need to access the properties of the regular expression,
          an alternative way of creating myArray is with this script:
        </p>
        <code
          >var myArray = /d(b+)d/g.exec('cdbbdbsbz'); // similar to
          "cdbbdbsbz".match(/d(b+)d/g); however, // "cdbbdbsbz".match(/d(b+)d/g)
          outputs Array [ "dbbd" ], while // /d(b+)d/g.exec('cdbbdbsbz') outputs
          Array [ 'dbbd', 'bb', index: 1, input: 'cdbbdbsbz' ].</code
        >

        <p>
          (See g different behaviors for further info about the different
          behaviors.) If you want to construct the regular expression from a
          string, yet another alternative is this script:
        </p>
        <code
          >var myRe = new RegExp('d(b+)d', 'g'); var myArray =
          myRe.exec('cdbbdbsbz');</code
        >

        <p>
          With these scripts, the match succeeds and returns the array and
          updates the properties shown in the following table.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="regular_expression_flags">
        <header>Regular Expression Flags</header>
        <p>
          Flag Description g Global search. i Case-insensitive search. m
          Multi-line search. s Allows . to match newline characters. u
          "unicode"; treat a pattern as a sequence of unicode code points y
          Perform a "sticky" search that matches starting at the current
          position in the target string.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>To include a flag with the regular expression, use this syntax:</p>
        <code>var re = /pattern/flags;</code>
        <code>var re = new RegExp('pattern', 'flags');</code>

        <p>
          Note that the flags are an integral part of a regular expression. They
          cannot be added or removed later.</p>
          <br>
          <p>For example,
          <code>re = /\w+\s/g</code> creates a regular expression that looks for
          one or more characters followed by a space, and it looks for this
          combination throughout the string.
        </p>

        <code
          >var re = /\w+\s/g; var str = 'fee fi fo fum'; var myArray =
          str.match(re); console.log(myArray); // ["fee ", "fi ", "fo "]</code
        >

        <p>You could replace the line:</p>

        <code>var re = /\w+\s/g;</code>
        <p>with:</p>
        <code> var re = new RegExp('\\w+\\s', 'g');</code>

        <p>and get the same result.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The behavior associated with the 'g' flag is different when the
          .exec() method is used. The 'g' flag is used with the .exec()method to
          get iterative progression.
        </p>

        <code
          >var xArray; while(xArray = re.exec(str)) console.log(xArray); //
          produces: // ["fee ", index: 0, input: "fee fi fo fum"] // ["fi ",
          index: 4, input: "fee fi fo fum"] // ["fo ", index: 7, input: "fee fi
          fo fum"]</code
        >

        <p>
          The m flag is used to specify that a multiline input string should be
          treated as multiple lines. If the m flag is used, ^ and $ match at the
          start or end of any line within the input string instead of the start
          or end of the entire string.
